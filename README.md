# proton-x50-boot-animation
For changing Proton X50 boot animation

## Thanks to Xeon1989 for providing the base script for all the X50 users to use.
## Modified by: sudomonkey 

## Steps
1. Copy all the files as is into a portable USB drive.
2. Add **.mp4** videos at the root directory of the USB drive. (Recommended resolution: 1920x720)
3. Plug the USB in and the script will automatically run.
4. Once the script has done, it will restart the IHU and the folder `b832bc61472727635baffcf25dd28e9f239273e2` will be renamed as `b832bc61472727635baffcf25dd28e9f239273e2_done`
5. The original Proton boot animation will be copied into USB drive for backup purposes `bootanimation_backup.mp4`
